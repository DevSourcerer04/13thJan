# Ishani’s 21st Birthday

A small, interactive web experience built as a birthday gift.

This project is designed to feel calm, personal, and thoughtful — using subtle animations, gentle typography, and a card-based scroll flow to tell a short story as you move through it.

## About the Project

The site is structured as a series of full-screen sections that reveal themselves as you scroll.  
Each section focuses on a different moment — from a simple greeting, to quiet reflections, to a playful interactive card — ending on a warm, friendly note.

The goal was to keep everything:
- minimal
- intentional
- emotionally light
- and easy to revisit
